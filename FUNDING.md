# FUNDING

This document explains how the webpack project uses donations received via OpenCollective.

## Purpose
Donations help keep webpack healthy, secure, and sustainable so the project can continue delivering reliable tooling and support for the community.

## Primary uses of donations
Donations are allocated to prioritized needs that support the project’s long-term stability:

- Core maintenance
    - Funding paid maintainers for critical bug fixes, release management, and triage.
    - Paying for focused maintenance sprints and high-priority issue work.
- Community and support
    - Sponsoring mentorship programs, and documentation improvements.

## Budgeting principles

- Prioritize work that increases stability, security, and user experience.
- Use funds transparently and minimize overhead.

## Transparency and reporting
- Donation receipts and expense records are published on the project’s OpenCollective page.
- Major one‑off expenditures are expended based on the core working group’s approval.

## How contributors and sponsors can help

- Donate via our OpenCollective page (link on the webpack website).
- Sponsor specific initiatives by contacting project maintainers with a proposal.
- Fix issues that are important to webpack.
