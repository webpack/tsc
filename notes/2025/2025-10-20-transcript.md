# 10/20/2025 Webpack TSC Meeting Transcript

**wunderacle:** At this point I wonder if we're even interested in doing meetings lol

**alexander.akait:** Just a lot of tasks right now(

**wunderacle:** I just keep observing that no one seems to remember our meetings besides of me lol

**wunderacle:** And that's a bit depressing

**wunderacle:** We have lots of stuff on our agenda https://github.com/webpack/tsc/issues/67

**wunderacle:** It also doesn't make sense a meeting of just me and @evenstensberg xD

**evenstensberg:** We need to add a meeting bot here so that people remember it
